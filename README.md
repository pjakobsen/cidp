Definition of Platform (DMP)
----------------------------

A data management platform (DMP), also called a unified data management platform (UDMP) is a centralized computing system for collecting, integrating and managing large sets of structured and unstructured data from disparate sources.

An effective DMP creates a unified development and delivery environment that provides access to consistent, accurate and timely data. The term is most often associated with products and development projects that promise to help marketers and publishers turn data from offline, online, web analytics and mobile channels into information that can be used to support business goals. 

An expensive vendor DMP might combine data management technologies and data analytics tools into a single software suite with an intuitive and easy to navigate executive dashboard. At its simplest, a DMP could just be a NoSQL database management system that imports data from multiple systems and allows marketers and publishers to view data in a consistent manner.
