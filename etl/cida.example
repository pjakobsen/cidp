'Title': 'National Water Quality and Availability Management Program'
'Description': 'The goal of this project is to help Government of Egypt institutions manage water resources in three key areas: improved quality/quantity of data on water; better analysis of supply and demand variables; and safe reuse of drainage water. The purpose of the Drainage Water Reuse component is to produce guidelines for reuse of drainage water in a manner that is safe for human health and for the environment. A monitoring pilot program assesses changes in water and soil quality, crop productivity, and pollutant levels due to drainage water reuse.'

'Expected Results': "This is a new feature, part of CIDA's efforts towards increasing transparency. Information will only be available for projects approved after October 15, 2011. For other projects, information on expected results is usually included in the description."
'Progress and Results Achieved': 'Results as of the project\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion on May 1, 2010: The project established an operational and sustainable national water quality and availability monitoring program; including operational information management and communications systems able to respond to public inquiries as well as those of the Minister of Water and Irrigation. As a result, current and accurate water quality data and information are now available to a wide variety of stakeholders via the internet, and supply-demand information is now being shared by numerous stakeholders. Water quality status reports are now regularly produced and used by both policy makers and water users for a variety of purposes including identification and mitigation of sources of pollution. Other products of the project include ISO certification of the Environmental Quality Laboratory, the only such laboratory in the Middle East to have achieved ISO certification and the development and implementation of drainage water reuse guidelines that have lead to significant improvements in soil and water management.'
