CIDA was also able to use this fund to foster joint donor support of initiatives on issues such as democracy, electoral observation, human rights and State reform at regional level. The Fund also increased the capacity of local implementing organisations with regular workshops on gender equality, budgeting and results-based management. In addition, the implementation of local projects provided lessons learned and best practices for the planning of the larger CIDA programming, especially the new Andean Regional Initiative on CSR. Specifically, the PPPSRF promoted the approval and implementation of key public policies, including the Transparency and Access to Information Law. It strengthened the National Accord Technical Secretariat and Forum, it contributed to the creation of a national system of strategic planning. To contribute to human rights protection, the fund supported the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and aided the provision of identity documents to poor and rural citizens. The Fund also fostered the participatory development of municipal budgets and development plans, produced tools for decision-makers (such as those to assist with efficient and transparent management in rural municipalities) a system to monitor and inform regional educational projects, and research on the state of children. It promoted the design of policies on conflicts prevention and on the right of indigenous people to consultation. In partnership with civil society organisations and private sector firms, local projects also delivered results towards improving local community economic growth.

"A030420001","2013-03-07","Hydrocarbon Regulation","The goal of this project is to strengthen public sector reform and support the sustainable management of the environment and natural resources. This improves the regulatory governance of the hydrocarbon sector in Bolivia in order to ensure sustainable resource development while maximizing benefits to Bolivia. This capacity building and institutional strengthening project builds on the achievements realized during the implementation of previous initiatives funded by the CIDA in Bolivia. The government agencies mandated to oversee the transformation and regulation of the hydrocarbon industry require some assistance in institutionalizing and maintaining new systems and procedures. These agencies are responsible for the management and sustainability of Bolivia's oil and gas resources and for ensuring that these resources are exploited in a technically and environmentally sound manner. These agencies have a key role in ensuring that Bolivia benefits economically and receives a fair return from development of their resources. The discovery of natural gas reserves has brought forth hope that a range of energy needs can now be addressed. The Bolivian government is faced with promoting strategies to develop or find new or alternative markets (increased exports, liquefied natural gas, petrochemical industry) and with promoting development that is in the best interests of the country. Given the abundance of natural gas, the Government of Bolivia is considering policies to promote domestic access to this resource, including in rural areas. By strengthening the capacity of regulatory agencies, the project helps ensure that Bolivia: effectively manages and regulates the hydrocarbon sector; finds and develops new or alternative markets for its natural gas reserves; increases domestic gas coverage and exports; receives a fair return on the development of its oil and natural gas resources; and obtains increased revenue from royalties and taxes in the sector.","Operational","2003","2013","Bolivia: 100%","IBM Canada Ltd.","Private sector development,Other","Oil and gas(032262): 60%,Energy policy and administrative management(023010): 40%","$ 13,250,000","This is a new feature, part of CIDA's efforts towards increasing transparency.

The changes upon implementation will help to make the sector more effective and attract investment. BHRAP supported the development of regulations, guidelines and capacity development to promote utilization of natural gas, which has resulted in four-fold increase in residential gas connections and ten-fold increase in natural gas vehicles, and the development of fertilizer and petrochemical plants. The Project supported the establishment of a hydrocarbon tax department within the Bolivian Revenue Agency modelled on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), which is responsible for the collection and auditing of over $2.3 billion of taxes collected from the sector in 2012. An effective royalty administration system was created which allows the Government of Bolivia to collect royalties in a transparent and accountable way, while making the rules and processes clearer for foreign investors. The Government of Bolivia’s total revenues from the hydrocarbon sector increased from US$1.4 billion to US$4.27 billion between 2006 and 2012. As a result, the Government of Bolivia is better able to finance its own poverty reduction programs. BHRAP helped establish an energy policy and planning unit within the Ministry of Hydrocarbons. As a result, the Government of Bolivia has improved capacity to forecast its energy needs and develop strategies to meet those needs. Improving access to energy for all Bolivians is a key component of Bolivia's poverty reduction strategy. The Project helped establish a new department within the state oil company and trained its staff to promote foreign investments in Bolivia in exploration/exploitation of hydrocarbon resources. As well, the Project designed and delivered a very innovative socio-environmental monitoring certificate-training program for indigenous representatives in the areas of influence of the hydrocarbon sector. A total of 75 indigenous students from sixteen indigenous communities have graduated from the program and most are now employed in the sector."

The purpose of this contribution is to support the Government of Ghana as it implements its second Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy. The objectives of this policy are: to enhance food security and emergency preparedness; to improve income growth; to increase competitiveness and enhance integration into domestic and international markets; to achieve sustainable management of land and the environment; to apply science and technology in food and agriculture development; and to enhance institutional coordination within Ghana. As with all budget support projects, Canada is working in close collaboration with other donors and the Government of Ghana to strengthen the effectiveness of its aid. This is achieved by: focussing on effective, transparent, and accountable country systems; increasing coordination and harmonization among donors; and reinforcing mutual accountability. Sector-wide budget support also fosters greater policy dialogue between CIDA, the Government of Ghana, and partners. This reinforces efforts for effective, focussed aid and long-term development results. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of this initiative is undertaken in coordination with other donors.","Terminating","2002","2012","Ghana: 100%","Government of Ghana","Private sector development","Agricultural policy and administrative management(031110): 25%,Agricultural co-operatives(031194): 25%,Food crop production(031161): 25%,Agricultural inputs(031150): 25%","$ 1,550,986","This is a new feature, part of CIDA's efforts towards increasing transparency.

Women farmers formed 40 percent of beneficiaries of the training. The training has built the capacity of FBOs to ensure efficient, equitable, and sustainable provision of services to members. (2) As a result of a nation-wide FBO registration exercise, over 5,000 FBOs were validated for inclusion in a national database. The validation has increased equitable access to basic farming services by women’s and men’s FBOs and their members. (3) To strengthen governance of the fund, the Farmer-Based Organizations Development Fund (FBODF) Board was reconstituted into the FBODF Steering Committee. This change also makes the fund more responsive to farmers. (4) An FBO policy framework has been developed and has received final input from stakeholders. The framework is designed to guide the development and operation of FBOs at all levels along the agricultural value chain in Ghana. (5) A total of 4,000 copies of the handbook “FBOs, Farmers and Facilitators” were distributed during the year, after the Minister of Food and Agriculture launched the handbook in April 2010. The handbook aims to help farmers to become spokespersons on extension knowledge and information sharing, and to keep farmers informed about policy-related issues that affect them."
