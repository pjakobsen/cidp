In order to run this code, you will need a web server that is capable of serving PHP pages. 

For windows, easiest way to do this is to install WAMP.  See http://www.wampserver.com

Instead of getting data from the NSI webservice, PHP accesses a static data file (project.json)

Usually, the job of the php script would be to turn the format returned by the webservice into something that Google Charts can understand.
